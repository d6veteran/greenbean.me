<p>SuperKablamo, LLC (“SuperKablamo”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting or using the the website at http://greenbean.me (the "Site"), SuperKablamo’s services and applications, and any other linked pages, features, or content offered from time to time by SuperKablamo in connection therewith (collectively, the "Service"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p> 

<p>Highlights of our privacy policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the most part, information you submit to the Service will be available only to users you designate as SuperKablamo ‘friends.’  ‘Friend’ relationships on the SuperKablamo Service are bilateral, meaning each party must approve of the friend linkage before it is enabled.  You can limit the amount of your SuperKablamo Service activity that is shared with your SuperKablamo friends through your privacy settings.</li>
<li>In some limited cases, your SuperKablamo Service activity is broadcast to the wider SuperKablamo community (e.g. showing your name in the ‘who’s here’ list after someone checks in to a given place).  You can opt out of such broadcasts through your privacy settings.</li>
<li>You can choose to broadcast your SuperKablamo Service activity to third party services like Facebook or Twitter, or you can opt out of doing so through your privacy settings.  You have full control on what SuperKablamo Service activity is broadcast to third party services such as Facebook and Twitter.</li>

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers SuperKablamo’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that SuperKablamo gathers when you are accessing SuperKablamo’s Service.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that SuperKablamo does not own or control, or to individuals that SuperKablamo does not employ or manage.  In addition, the Service contains links to outside sources, both ones we have added ourselves and ones that members have submitted.  While we attempt to provide links only to those sites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites.  We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any web sites you visit.</p>

<h2>What Personal Information Does SuperKablamo Collect?</h2>

<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service.  In connection with the Service, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Service, which allows users to identify each other.  We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>

<h3>PersonalInformation You Provide to Us:</h3>

<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, user name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, use information and browser information.</p>

<p>The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.  We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network, and to develop new tools for the community.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>

<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Service or services.  SuperKablamo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</li>
<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  SuperKablamo only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, SuperKablamo never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
  
<h3>Email Communications:</h3>

<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from SuperKablamo if your computer supports this type of program. SuperKablamo uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service.  If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process, by making a modification on your account settings page.</p>

<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>

<ul>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. SuperKablamo cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</li>
</li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Service’s most attractive features.</li>
<li>Ads appearing on the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SuperKablamo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION USING THE SERVICE</h2>

<p>The Service is primarily designed to help you share information, including your location, with others.  This not only includes the information that you provide directly to SuperKablamo, but also information that you broadcast to third party services using the Service.  You can control your information through your privacy settings accessible through the ‘settings’ tab once you’re logged into the Service.</h2>   

<p>Information you submit to the Service will be available to users of the Service that you allow to access such information (friends etc.).  Your name and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Service network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your information unless they have a relationship to you (friends etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.</p>   

<p>Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Service, that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and, unless selected otherwise, may be available to the wider SuperKablamo community or may be published on the SuperKablamo website, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines. Individuals reading this information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in Shouts or Tips or other user-inputted content that you create in the Service (location or otherwise).</p> 

<p>While the Service does allow you to note your location at restaurants, bars, stores (and so) throughout your community, at no time does SuperKablamo ask you to provide your home address.  You should be aware that if you or your friends add your home as a new venue in the Service database and that information is published on the Service (for example, via a user checking in to that home venue), that information may be published by third parties without our control.</p>

<p>The Service allows you to connect with certain third party services (e.g., Twitter, Facebook and other similar services).  When you broadcast information to such third party services, such information is no longer under the control of SuperKablamo and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties.  Additionally, certain information may be made available to third party developers using our Application Programming Interface (“API”) if you or your ‘friend’ use third party applications developed by such third party developers. Use of third party applications developed using our API are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party developers.  You should be aware that such third party applications may expose user locations in broad and creative ways and some third party services may permit you to make your information publicly available and accessible by everyone on the Internet.  You can control whether your SuperKablamo activity is broadcast to third parties through your privacy settings.</p>
